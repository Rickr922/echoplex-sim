# Echoplex Ep-3 Simulator
This archive contains a virtual model of the Echoplex Ep-3 tape delay. The effect has been developed using Faust, a high level functional programming language for audio, in the context of a project for the Sound Processing exam (Sound and Music Computing MSc, Aalborg University, Copenhagen, 2019).

The paper Faust Model of the Echoplex Tape Delay, included in the repo, provides more information on the algorithm.
